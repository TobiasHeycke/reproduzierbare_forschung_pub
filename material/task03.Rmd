# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 
For more details on using R Markdown see [bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown).

## Using R and Markdown

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
m.cars <- mean(cars$speed)
```

And you can use in-line code to show your results in the text: `r m.cars`.

You could also run R calculations in the code like this `r m.cars * 2`, but ensure that your text is still readable.
